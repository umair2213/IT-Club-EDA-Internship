Netflix Movies Dataset - Cleaning and pre -processing data
Overview
The project focuses on cleaning and preparing Dataset of Netflix films to prepare it for further analysis. The main functions include handling missing values, detecting and uncovering and using changes and scaling.

The steps performed
Handle missing values
Depending on the column type, missing values ​​were handled using copying methods such as the fish, median and mode. The column with very missing values ​​was dropped to maintain the quality of the data.

Handling sizes
Outlair was detected using the Interquerial Range (IQR) method. To reduce the effect, extreme values ​​were overshadowed within the acceptable boundaries.

Change and scaling
To improve the data division, log transformation was used on sloping data. Numerical functions were normalized using standardization (Z-score) and min-max scaling to ensure stability in different variables.

Result and insight
The dataset is now clean, pre -measured and ready for further analysis. The missing values ​​are filled, the outbreak is handled, and the numerical data is well scale, which ensures better performance for future machine learning models or insight generations.
